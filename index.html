		If You Forget Me by Pablo Neruda

			If You Forget Me
			I want you to know
			one thing.

			You know how this is:
			if I look
			at the crystal moon, at the red branch
			of the slow autumn at my window,
			if I touch
			near the fire
			the impalpable ash
			or the wrinkled body of the log,
			everything carries me to you,
			as if everything that exists,
			aromas, light, metals,
			were little boats
			that sail
			toward those isles of yours that wait for me.

			Well, now,
			if little by little you stop loving me
			I shall stop loving you little by little.

			If suddenly
			you forget me
			do not look for me,
			for I shall already have forgotten you.

			If you think it long and mad,
			the wind of banners
			that passes through my life,
			and you decide
			to leave me at the shore
			of the heart where I have roots,
			remember
			that on that day,
			at that hour,
			I shall lift my arms
			and my roots will set off
			to seek another land.

			But
			if each day,
			each hour,
			you feel that you are destined for me
			with implacable sweetness,
			if each day a flower
			climbs up to your lips to seek me,
			ah my love, ah my own,
			in me all that fire is repeated,
			in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
			my love feeds on your love, beloved,
			and as long as you live it will be in your arms
			without leaving mine.
